# Banner
Just a Twitter or LinkedIn Banner Idea. While following an 11-Hour CSS 2022 Course, I saw this idea and wanted to style it my way. I can use it as an actual banner to a Twitter account or even a LinkedIn one. If it were pricesly created for LinkedIn, I would most likely do it in a more professional way, but still have something that is my hobby nested inside it. This was created in about 20 minutes because it was for my own fun, nothing too deep. Still, very proud of how it came out.
